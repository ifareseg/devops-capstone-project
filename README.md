# devops-capstone-project

This is my IBM DevOps Capstone Project — a Customer Accounts Microservice
built using Flask, TDD, Docker, Kubernetes, and Tekton CI/CD pipeline.
This project is part of the IBM DevOps Professional Certificate Capstone.
It implements a Customer Accounts RESTful microservice using Agile, CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the IBM DevOps Capstone Project.  
It implements a Customer Accounts Microservice using Flask.

## Features
- Create an account
- Read an account
- Update an account
- Delete an account
- List all accounts

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes / OpenShift
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Build Status
The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration.  
All tests and lint checks run automatically on every push.



## Project layout

The code for the microservice is contained in the `service` package. All of the test are in the `tests` folder. The code follows the **Model-View-Controller** pattern with all of the database code and business logic in the model (`models.py`), and all of the RESTful routing on the controller (`routes.py`).

```text
├── service         <- microservice package
│   ├── common/     <- common log and error handlers
│   ├── config.py   <- Flask configuration object
│   ├── models.py   <- code for the persistent model
│   └── routes.py   <- code for the REST API routes
├── setup.cfg       <- tools setup config
└── tests                       <- folder for all of the tests
    ├── factories.py            <- test factories
    ├── test_cli_commands.py    <- CLI tests
    ├── test_models.py          <- model unit tests
    └── test_routes.py          <- route unit tests
```

## Data Model

The Account model contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Optional |
|------|------|----------|
| id | Integer| False |
| name | String(64) | False |
| email | String(64) | False |
| address | String(256) | False |
| phone_number | String(32) | True |
| date_joined | Date | False |

## Your Task

Complete this microservice by implementing REST API's for `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `LIST` while maintaining **95%** code coverage. In true **Test Driven Development** fashion, first write tests for the code you "wish you had", and then write the code to make them pass.

## Local Kubernetes Development

This repo can also be used for local Kubernetes development. It is not advised that you run these commands in the Cloud IDE environment. The purpose of these commands are to simulate the Cloud IDE environment locally on your computer. 

At a minimum, you will need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your computer. For the full development environment, you will also need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace. All of these can be installed manually by clicking on the links above or you can use a package manager like **Homebrew** on Mac of **Chocolatey** on Windows.

Please only use these commands for working stand-alone on your own computer with the VSCode Remote Container environment provided.

1. Bring up a local K3D Kubernetes cluster

    ```bash
    $ make cluster
    ```

2. Install Tekton

    ```bash
    $ make tekton
    ```

3. Install the ClusterTasks that the Cloud IDE has

    ```bash
    $ make clustertasks
    ```

You can now perform Tekton development locally, just like in the Cloud IDE lab environment.
